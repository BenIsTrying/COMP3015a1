# COMP3015 30% assignment

## Which version Visual Studio and Operating System you used to test/write the code locally? 

### Visual stduio version

Visual Studio 2022

### OS 

Windows 11 Pro
Version 10.0.22631 


## How does it work? 

This code works by calling on fucntions from *Glad*, *GLM*, *GLFW*, and *openGL*.
All versions relate to the sugestted version from COMP3015 overview of assignments. 

## How does your code fit together and how should a programmer navigate it (not intended to be an exercise in formally documenting the code)? 

The program consists of mutiple pages with many uses, there are:

#### Shaders
These files contain information to do with the vertec and fragment shaders, these play a role in how the objs or verticies are shaded and processed.
This is where anythng like lighting effects are done.

#### Header Files
The header files work as a page dedicated to one task which usualy involes creating and storing classes.

#### CPP Files
The CPP files are where many of the main processes happen, this is where the main structure of the program is where files like the *.H* files are called and used.


## Anything else which will help us to understand how your prototype works.
